NotQuiteRSS is a fork of QuiteRSS, an open-source, cross-platform RSS/Atom news feed reader written in C++/Qt.

The application renders articles with QTextBrowser, without QtWebKit or
QtWebEngine. See [INSTALL](INSTALL) for dependencies and [ARTICLE_VIEW.md](ARTICLE_VIEW.md)
for rendering behavior, image-format plugins and validation notes.

Notification sounds use miniaudio with built-in decoding, without Qt Multimedia
or GStreamer codec plugins. See INSTALL for the pinned header preparation step.
